General Descirption

I'm trying to store a list of tips/tricks in R, particularly for data manipulation with the data table package and plotting with the ggplot package (where I store some of the most common plots I use so I can refer to these as a template).

I am writing the code here as R notebook which I'm trying to move towards using in the main. There is lots of information available online about this format but it basically means that there are two versions of each file: 
.Rmd - this will run in R studio 
.nb.html - this will display the code and printouts of any plots etc. as a notebook in an internet browser. This is super helpful when you want to see the analysis, output nicely presented and without having to open and run the code from R itself. Super useful for sharing with others as well. Note: you cannot view the notebooks within Github itself. Use: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
